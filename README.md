## lib/mv-utils.ts
Library used in fixed and character camera

There are some options value for users:

---

- reverseTargetJudge
  
  By default, this script removes all tracks except for the ones in the targets array, set this to true to remove the tracks in the targets array instead

  For example, if you want to keep post-processing but don't want DoF, set this true and target array to `['"Main Camera"', '"Sekai Dof Track"']`

- removeMeshOffTrack

  In some MV, characters may become disappeared due to staging

  This option prevents it

- ENABLE_THIRD_PERSON

  As the name suggests

- changeFOV

  As the name suggests

- targetFOV

  Specify the fov value that will be applied when changeFOV is true

---

For reverseTargetJudge and removeMeshOffTrack please note that they might not work

This is because the script will remove tracks with a specific name, but the track supposed to remove may have a different name, so in that case it has no effect

## misc/
